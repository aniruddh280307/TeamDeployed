# 🎯 Weather Briefing Summary - FIXED!

## ✅ **Issue Resolved: Weather Briefing Summary Now Working**

The weather briefing summary was showing "AI summary unavailable - please check weather data manually" due to two main issues that have now been fixed.

## 🚀 **Problems Fixed**

### **1. Port Conflict Issue** ✅
**Problem**: Multiple server processes were running on port 8000, causing `EADDRINUSE` errors
**Solution**: Changed server port from 8000 to 3001
```javascript
// Before (causing conflicts)
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8000;

// After (working)
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;
```

### **2. Frontend Configuration** ✅
**Problem**: Frontend was still trying to connect to port 8000
**Solution**: Updated frontend configuration to use port 3001
```javascript
// Before (wrong port)
const BACKEND_API_CONFIG = {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8000',

// After (correct port)
const BACKEND_API_CONFIG = {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3001',
```

### **3. Manual Summary Function** ✅
**Problem**: Manual summary was not being called properly
**Solution**: Manual summary function was already correctly implemented, just needed server to start properly

## 🎯 **Working Weather Briefing Summary**

The weather briefing summary now displays properly:

```
